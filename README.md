# Libitina

This is the next chatbot engine for Monika, replacing the Dialogflow implementation on v1.  
It's a simple Tensorflow chatbot capable of learning from user context.

The chatbot is a version of [Conchylicultor/DeepQA](https://github.com/Conchylicultor/DeepQA) that is modified to run off YAML config files and interface with a HTTP API.
