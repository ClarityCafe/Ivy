## Ivy

Ivy is a REST-based chatbot server based from [Chatlearner](https://github.com/bshao001/ChatLearner).

Its designed with Flask and TensorFlow and purposely made to provide a more natural conversational experience.

## Relationship with Scarlet

Ivy was supposed to be Scarlet's emotional detection engine but seeing the work being too far-fetched for the team scale,
we discontinued the original roadmap and seeked for better solutions. Ivy then became Scarlet's successor with the latter
being more feature complete than research-only.

While we dropped the emotion detection engine, it doesn't mean we're dropping it entirely. We plan to support it soon!
