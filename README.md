## Rebecca

This is the fallback service for Monika if the Dialogflow service goes down.

It's a simple Tensorflow chatbot capable of learning from user context.

### Neural network layout

Rebecca uses the LTST Brain layout and the recurrent model layout. Recurrent Layout allows
the bot to learn from context vector encoded by the human and using a long term short term network
allows the brain to remember words or phrases.
